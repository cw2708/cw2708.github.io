    <h3>1. were blocked on a simple problem:</h3>
    <p>
      I once was blocked in a simple problem when I was having to do something
      called accessing objects within an array. I was unaware of how I was to
      get the object out of the array and what is recommended is using dot
      notation where you say the name of the array and then follow that up with
      a dot notation eg array.object but in this specific case we were not only
      dealing with and object within an array but we were dealing with an object
      within two different arrays which I was not used to yet so by the end of
      the session I was unable to complete the code that I had done and it lead
      to me having to do research at home in order to solve the problem.
    </p>
    <h3>2. elegantly solved a problem.</h3>
    <p>
      A time that I elegantly solved a problem was during the team challenge on
      Friday we were in a situation where we were dealing with states. For some
      reason we couldn’t get to images to change and we were trying to change
      state using true or false but we couldn’t get it working. I decided to go
      on my laptop just to research and all it took was seeing that you didn’t
      have to use true or false to declare but you can instead use an image to
      see if it is equal to the src and if its not then you change the src. It
      completely solved our problem and looking back later it actually refracted
      our code.

    <h3>
      3. Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving
      techniques/processes:
    </h3>
    <p>
      Pseudocode: I am using Pseudocode but I often forget to be using it within
      my projects as I often think that I will be the only one looking at my
      code or that I will be coding and explaining with a person next to me so
      they will be able to understand but I haven’t had a case yet where I have
      had to merge changes to a main branch where pseudocode would definitely be
      more important. Trying something: I think I am very confident on just
      trying something I know how to comment out and protect code if I need to
      and I know how to try new methods or at least have two different ways of
      solving the problem. Rubber ducky method: I don’t really understand the
      point of the rubber ducky method most of the time in my head I will just
      think the code line by line not really talking to an inanimate object its
      easier for me to interpret and read in my head step by step how the
      computer is under standing each line and its response to it. Reading error
      messages: I relatively confident with reading error messages for code I
      still have some considerable trouble with trying to read and understand
      typescript code as often it is hard to understand where exactly the
      problem is as more often then not it is quite untraceable.
      Console.logging: I am very confident using console logging I rarely get
      the syntax wrong and it is a great way to help me understand the data that
      I am using. Googling: I am pretty good at googling but sometimes I forget
      to just read deeper into the source documentation or material I will often
      find myself looking at random stack overflows that don’t help me
      understand the concepts properly and lead to me learning not as much
      Asking your peers for help: I think I am good when I feel like I am
      working with someone else but for cases where I am solo working and have
      to ask a pair I feel anxiety and embarrassment to do so as I want to be
      able to figure a problem out myself and I don’t want to reveal my
      weaknesses to others. Asking coaches for help: I have a really hard time
      coming to coaches for help I would rather just have zero human interaction
      when I am working alone. I would only seek out a coach for help if it was
      my last option. I also feel that when I do reach out to help from a coach
      it was cheating as I could have just done the research myself. I have
      found myself talking to coaches more often now that you can quite easily
      be left behind but I think that if I went into a working environment I
      might struggle. Improving your process with reflection: I don’t like to
      reflect on the work I’ve done and I don’t like to write it down either I
      find it pointless going to write something down that I will never ever
      refer back to at a later date.
    </p>
    <h3>
      4. Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what
      made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?
    </h3>
    <p>
      There was a time when we were focusing on routing and I decided that my
      best option was to wait for the code from class came out rather than ask
      for a teacher help with understanding the syntax as we had simply just
      forgotten the syntax but understood the concept that we had to do.
