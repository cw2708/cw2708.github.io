    <h3>Taha Tinana (Physical Wellbeing)</h3>
    <p>
      I Will go to the gym twice per week to stay in good physical shape. I Will
      continue to eat a balenced diet and take time out to cook that type of
      meal. I Will avoid taking unnessesary risks that lead to injury.
    </p>
    <h3>Taha WhƒÅnau (Family Wellbeing)</h3>
    <p>
      I Will try to sit down for a least one meal a day with my family even if
      it has to be over the phone. I Will support my Brother with his sporting
      ventures to make sure that he succeeds to the best of his ability.
    </p>
    <h3>Taha Hinengaro (Emotional and Mental Wellbeing)</h3>
    <p>
      I will turn of all of my devices an hour before bed time to make sure that
      I am able to go to sleep easy. I will make sure on the weekend to take
      some time for myself to make sure that I don't lose my mind. I will make
      sure to share my thoughts and feelings with the people around me that I
      care about when I am feeling down.
    </p>
    <h3>Taha Wairua (Spiritual Wellbeing)</h3>
    <p>
      I will make sure to take the time out to thank people who do nice things
      for me to try be more grateful.
    </p>
    <h3>Whenua (Interconnections to the land and environment)</h3>
    <p>
      I will go for walks outside to feel a connection to the land and area
      where I live. I will contribute to watering our garden and mowing the lawn
      to nourish the ecosystem.
