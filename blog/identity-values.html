    <h3>
      Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
      you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
      made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
    </h3>
    <p>
      In a previous job, I encountered a situation where a customer asked me to
      clarify information on a product that was mistaken by myself. I chose to
      be transparent and inform my manager about the error I had made informing
      the customer despite the potential fallout. Looking back, I believe I made
      the right choice and my manger appreciated my honesty and told me that it
      was better I had told him then not. Honesty is a core value for me, and
      compromising it would have eroded my integrity. While it was a difficult
      decision at the time, I’m proud that I upheld my principles.

    <h3>
      Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your
      values and identity.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Growing up in a close-knit family and being part of a high peformance
      rowing team that values integrity, hard work, and empathy has shaped my
      values and identity significantly. Additionally, interactions with diverse
      communities and exposure to different cultural perspectives have broadened
      my understanding of the world. These experiences have instilled in me a
      deep sense of respect for others, adaptability, and a commitment to
      continuous learning and growth.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning
      journey.
    </h3>
    <p>
      One of my strengths is my ability to adapt quickly to new situations and
      environments and my out of the box thinking. This will be invaluable
      during my learning journey, especially when faced with challenges or
      unfamiliar concepts. Additionally, my strong communication skills that I
      have learned through customer interviews and presentations enable me to
      articulate ideas effectively, facilitate discussions, and collaborate with
      peers, enhancing the learning experience for myself and others.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
      development. How might these affect your learning journey?
    </h3>
    <p>
      While I am eager to learn and grow, I recognise that I can sometimes be
      overly self-critical, which may hinder my confidence. Additionally, I tend
      to set high expectations for myself , which can lead to feelings of
      frustration or cause procrastination as I find myself daunted be the task
      and my own expectations if I don’t meet them immediately. To address these
      limitations, I plan to practice self-compassion, focus on celebrating
      small victories, and seek feedback from mentors or peers to gain
      perspective and improve continuously. Another one of my limitations is my
      trouble that I have putting my ideas onto paper with a pen.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others,
      but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the
      time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other
      strategies you would try now and why.
    </h3>
    <p>
      In a team project at the UOA summer lab, I encountered resistance from a
      team member who was reluctant to collaborate and share workload. To
      address this, I tried fostering open communication by expressing
      understanding of their concerns and emphasising the shared goal. However,
      this approach had limited success due to entrenched attitudes. Reflecting
      on this, I realise the importance of early team alignment and setting
      clear expectations. In future situations, I would establish roles and
      responsibilities upfront, facilitate regular check-ins to address issues
      promptly, and leverage conflict resolution techniques to ensure a
      harmonious team dynamic.
