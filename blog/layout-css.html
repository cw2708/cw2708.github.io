      <h2>Margin</h2>
      <p>
        "Margins in web design control the space around elements. They help
        create a clean look by setting the distance between elements on a
        webpage. By adjusting margins, designers can organize content and make
        it visually pleasing. Margins are like the breathing space between
        different parts of a webpage, making sure it looks neat and easy to
        read."
      </p>
      <h2>Border</h2>
      <p>
        "Borders in web design are like frames around elements. They define the
        edges and give a structured look to a webpage. Designers use borders to
        separate different sections and emphasize specific elements. Borders
        come in different styles, adding a creative touch to the design. By
        adjusting border thickness and color, designers can match them to the
        overall look of the webpage, guiding user attention and improving the
        overall experience."
      </p>
      <h2>Padding</h2>
      <p>
        "Padding in web design is the space inside an element, between its
        content and border. It's crucial for making content readable and not
        cramped. Designers adjust padding to create the right distance between
        text or images and the element's border. Proper padding ensures that
        content looks well-spaced and doesnâ€™t feel cluttered, making the webpage
        visually appealing."
