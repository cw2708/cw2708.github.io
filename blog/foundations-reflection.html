      What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due
      to the core learning?
    </h3>
    <p>
      I think when I started the program I heavily overlooked the core learning
      because I felt that I was above the material because I had worked in
      different professional enviroments but then working through the material I
      learned that I have quite a few gaps within my people skills.<br />
      Another thing that I learned about myself is what my true values and
      identity is because I never really think about it but it should be
      something that I think about and share when doing things like a job
      interview<br />
      Last thing that I learned is that I overestimated the time constraints
      that it would take to complete the core vs the tech assignments I often
      found that I was spending more time on the core assignments than the tech
      assignments and I found that it showed that it was an area where I needed
      to work on.

    <h3>
      What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
      programming?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Guiding Principles: Values serve as guiding principles that shape how
      programmers approach their work. For example, integrity and honesty drive
      programmers to write clean, transparent, and ethical code. Decision
      Making: Programmers often encounter ethical dilemmas or situations where
      they must prioritize certain features or approaches. Their values
      influence these decisions, ensuring that they align with ethical standards
      and contribute positively to society. Team Collaboration: Shared values
      within a development team foster a cohesive work environment where members
      respect each other's contributions, communicate openly, and collaborate
      effectively toward common goals.

    <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
    <p>
      I think what suprised myself the most about the core learnings exercise
      was how much new stuff I learned that I had never even heard about I
      thought most of the content would be concepts that I had never heard
      before but I was suprised to find out that maybe their was more content
      new to me then old content that I had heard about before.
    </p>
    <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
    <p></p>
    <h3>
      Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
      focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
    </h3>
    <p>
      I think because ultimiatly when working for someone else one of the
      biggest concerns for them is not going to nessecerilly be how good of a
      coder you are but rather how well you get on with other people because
      work is all about being around other people.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of
      time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead?
      Justify your answer.
    </h3>
    <p>
      I think learning core is important to teach to make sure everyone has the
      people skills it may not be applicatble for everyone but it still have
      some concepts that are healthy for coders to learn.
